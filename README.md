This script is custom made to work for www.olx.com.ng
the site has no API/package so i had to find a crude way around it

there are 2 files 
the .py file and the .bat file 

the two files should be kept in the same directory
the .bat file can be used to launch the script from command propmt

if you do not have the path set, navigate to the folder containg the files 
and run '***.bat file' form there.
